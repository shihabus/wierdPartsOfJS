    <h4>
      Inheritance in JS
    </h4>
    <p>
      <b>Inheritance</b> is, one Object getting access to the properties and
      methods of another Object. JS supports something called
      <i>Prototypal Inheritance</i>. This is much more simple, extensible and
      felxible when compared to Inheritance in other programming languages.
      Programming languages like C,C++ and Java supports
      <i>Classical Inheritance</i>.
    </p>

    <h4>Prototype</h4>
    <p>
      Objects are collection of key value pairs. They have user defined
      properties and methods and much more hidden or default created ones too.
      One such property is <code>__proto__</code> which is called the
      <b><i>Prototype</i></b
      >. This property is available on all the Objects. The
      <code>__proto__</code>
      Object can have its own properties and methods, which the parent Object
      can use and consume as, as it's own.
    </p>
    <h5>Prototype chain</h5>
    <p>
      <code>
        var person = { <br />
        &nbsp name:'default' <br />
        &nbsp getname:function(){ <br />
        &nbsp &nbsp return this.name <br />
        &nbsp } <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        var shihab = { <br />
        &nbsp name:'Shihab' <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        shihab.__proto__ = person; <br />
      </code>
      <br />

      In the above code, if I do <code>shihab.getname()</code>, the engine try
      to find <code>getname()</code> in <code>shihab</code> Object. As it wasn't
      found it will move to <code>shihab.__proto__</code>. As it is available
      over there, it stops and uses that method. This is called
      <b>Prototypal Chain</b>. This comes into play for Objects.
      <code>__proto__</code> can inturn have its own <code>__proto__</code> and
      this can go on. It goes in search of property and method until the
      <code>__proto__</code> property returns <code>null</code>. <br />
      <br />
      As it is evident from the example, no one has to mention
      <code>object_name.__proto__.property_name</code> to find the properties
      (or methods). <code>object_name.property_name</code> is enough and rest
      engine will take care. So from outside it is like, that particular method
      or property is within the parent Object, even though it is referred via
      it's <code>prototype</code>.
      <br />
      <br />
      In JS all are Objects or Primitives. Everything have a prototype by
      default. The inbuilt methods are made available to them through this
      <code>__proto__</code> Object.
