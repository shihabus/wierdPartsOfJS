    <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
    <p>
      By name JavaScript seems to be more related to Java and by syntax more
      towards C++. But JS have more features than these language.
      <br />
      JS support something called Function Programming. This is only supported
      by languages which have functions as first class objects, where functions
      can be assigned to variables, passed around and so on. Other languages of
      this sort are lisp and ML.
      <br />
      Functional Programming advocates a new way of programming and force us to
      think in terms of reusable functions that can be passed around. All the
      repeated works are abstracted into reusable functions, which can inturn
      return other functions.
