    <h2>Execution Context creation has two phases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>Creation Phase</h3></li>
      <p>
          In this phase 
          <ul>
              <li>Global Object</li>
              <li><code>this</code></li>
              <li>Outer Environment link</li>
          </ul>
          are created.
          <br> Memory space for functions are variables are 
          created and alloted. 
          <h4>Hoisting</h4>
          <p>The named function declaration are 
              moved to the top, along 
              with their body</p>
          <p>The variables declared <code>var</code> are 
            initialized 
            with <code>undefined</code></p> 
            <i title="undefined">
                <code>undefined</code> indicates the variable was declared
                but never got assigned. If the variable wasn't declared
                at all, it would throw a <b>ReferenceError</b>.
            </i>
            <p>
          Actually none of them are being physically 
          being moved to the top, 
          rather 
          their memory allocation is mistook, 
          thus called <b>Hoisting</b>.</p>
      </p>

      <li><h3>Execution Phase</h3></li>
      <p>In Execution phase the code is run line by line.</p>
    </ul>
